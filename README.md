# Real Estate Property Reservations API
This project consists of Django REST APIs for a real estate property reservations system which currently consists of three types of database entities:
- Property
- Announcement
- Reservation

Every Announcement instance is associated with only one Property instance and every Reservation instance is associated with only one Announcement instance. The APIs should not allow deleting Announcement instances or editing Reservation instances. Additional checks are in place to prevent a new Reservation instance from going over the number of remaining vacancies for its associated property, also checking for other Reservation instances with coinciding check-in/check-out dates. See the table below for relevant API usage information (searches may be refined according to field by using the `Filters` button at the top right of the API screens).

**Important: After the initial setup, head to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and login with your superuser credentials to authenticate before using the API.**

- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install django`
- `pip install djangorestframework`
- `pip install django-filter`

Start the database and create a superuser:
- `python manage.py migrate`
- `python manage.py createsuperuser`

Setup the database and load the fixtures to provide initial data:
- `python manage.py makemigrations khanto`
- `python manage.py migrate`
